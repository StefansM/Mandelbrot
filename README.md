#Introduction

This is a small piece of software that displays Mandelbrot fractals in a
terminal window, mainly as a technical exercise.

#Compilation

The code should compile with a C99-compliant compiler an a POSIX-compliant-ish
system (that is, most systems). To compile, simply run:

    make

#Usage

There's nothing fancy here. Just run:

    ./mandelbrot

#Bugs

Please report any bugs to <stefans.mezulis@gmail.com>.

#Thanks

Thanks to Yu-Jie Lin for supplying the makefile.
